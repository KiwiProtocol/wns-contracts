# wns
Wormhole Name Service (WNS) is the first ever multichain naming system designed to provide a unified, user-friendly way to interact with blockchain addresses and decentralized resources across all blockchains using the Wormhole interoperability protocol.


## Technical Description
The WNS smart contracts are designed to manage name registration, resolution, and ownership of blockchain addresses. Built with cross-chain compatibility in mind, these contracts leverage the Wormhole interoperability protocol to synchronize data across multiple blockchains.

## Architecture

WNS is designed as a modular, cross-chain solution that can interact with multiple blockchains through the Wormhole protocol. Here’s a high-level view of the architecture:

1. **Root Registry Contract**: Deployed on Ethereum and manages the top-level domains (TLDs).
2. **Subdomain Registrar**: Deployed on each EVM-compatible chain and manages second-level domain registrations.
3. **Resolver Contracts**: These contracts map WNS names to blockchain addresses, decentralized storage, and other resources.
4. **Cross-Chain Integration**: Through Wormhole's interoperability layer, data between chains remains synchronized, ensuring that names can be resolved across multiple networks.
5. **Governance**: Decentralized governance via a DAO, ensuring protocol upgrades and modifications are done transparently and securely.

## Prerequisites
To compile, deploy, and run the WNS contracts locally, you'll need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v12.x or higher)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)
- [Wormhole SDK](https://wormhole.com/reference/sdk/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A local Ethereum blockchain like [Hardhat Network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wns-contracts.git
cd wns-contracts
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install Hardhat and all necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables for network configuration:
```bash
INFURA_API_KEY=your-infura-api-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your-etherscan-api-key
```

### 4. Compile the Contracts
To compile the contracts, use Hardhat’s compile command:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 5. Deploy Contracts Locally
You can deploy the contracts on a local Hardhat network by running the following command:
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
In a separate terminal, deploy the contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### 6. Deploy to a Testnet (e.g., Goerli)
Ensure you have some test ETH on Goerli, then run:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

### 7. Verify Contracts on Etherscan
Once deployed, you can verify the contracts on Etherscan:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network goerli DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor Arguments"
```

## Running Tests
You can run the test suite using Hardhat:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
